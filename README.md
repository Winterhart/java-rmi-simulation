### How to make it work ?
- Download and Extract the `.zip` folder
- You need to indicate some absolute path in the file `ServerConfigurator.java`
you need to replace `MAIN_TREE_FOLDER` and `CENTRAL_REPO_LOCATION` by
the location of the `storage folder` and the `CENTRAL` folder.
- Have installed Java RMI Plugin
- Make sure you have the right configuration and security policy
- Go to the file `ServerLauncher.java` and run it
